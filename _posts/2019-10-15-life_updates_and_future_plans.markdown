## The Past Half-Year
Hello everyone, I am very happy to get to the point where I can share my current life status and my future goals towards becoming a software engineer through Flatiron School. It's been a while since I've written, and I am sorry. Throughout the past 7 months, I have gone through many things that have delayed my participation in the course. Unfortunately, this includes events in my life that have to lead to decreasing physical and mental health. Not to bore anyone with the details, but it was an arduous time where I didn't believe I could continue with the course. This in of itself was a blow to me because of the time and money I had spent getting to where I was at that point. I had spent so much time learning skills that I had such difficulty learning before partaking in this course and applying them on projects I had a passion for. 

I am looking towards the work I have done throughout the time at Flatiron School and see something that I don't want to lose. Back in university, I didn't even have the confidence to create a New York Knicks Basketball fan page through HTML and CSS. Now I'm making CLI applications that allow the user to ask for player stats. For me, this was a point of pride that shined through whatever ailments I had during this past half-year. So, I am here to say that I will complete the Flatiron School Curriculum with the love for creativity and learning that brought me to its doorstep. In order to do this, I need a plan, and this post is what will keep me accountable for that.

## Self Reflection
To understand where to go from this, I have to recognize what worked and what didn't work for me in the past when working on the curriculum. 

### Strengths
* Projects
* Individual reading

When it came to projects, I was inspired to hit the ground running immediately every time they were imminent. The freedom to add personal elements to these portfolio projects gave me an extra boost in productivity. I also was very intent on learning different things that may help these projects that weren't currently explained yet at that point in the curriculum. I wanted to go the extra mile to incorporate some features that would make my projects more notable to the viewer. Finally, my participation in my cohort was something I found myself proud of. 

### Weaknesses
* Utilization of Resources
* Communication

Flatiron School is a great example of an entity that truly believes in their mission. I have not once felt inadequately armed to tackle the curriculum. The education coach system is truly something I believe has helped me greatly, and the community aspect of Flatiron School has given me good access to resources that may help me throughout the course. Unfortunately, there were many times where I didn't access these materials and resources because I had a desire to prove myself in these challenges. That attitude has hindered me, and I look forward to working towards reversing that and embracing the wealth of knowledge that Flatiron School provides.

Along with that, I look forward to communicating more with my coaches and fellow classmates. Not only will this help me in the long run, but I may also be able to help those who may have had a similar experience with me in the curriculum.

## The Plan

So, with this moment of self-reflection, I have devised a plan in order to finish the Flatiron School curriculum.

### 5 Goals a Day Schedule

Throughout my months of working as a Flatiron Student, I always set my hours expectancy per week to be very high, so I could catch up with other peers that are ahead of me. However, this would lead to short bursts of productivity that never amounted to consistency. I think one reason for this is because I kept on looking at the work I would do as solely being reading and labs that day. Although this is a very important aspect of my journey, I recognize that incorporating my own goals of learning could help me through the learning process. My enjoyment towards the projects has shown me that I can certainly get a good amount of work done when focusing on the creation aspect of things. This leads to my first goal: ***Work on an independent Web Development Project*** . 

The second goal would be focusing on the community aspect of it all. I want to get more engaged in these channels that host so many wonderful students going through their own respective journeys. I see some students express their issues, solutions, questions to the channel all the time. I hope to not only provide my own issues and questions, but also provide solutions and feedback to those asking for them. I hope to expand upon both my communication and teaching capabilities through this. Therefore, my second goal is: ***Become more involved in the community***.

My third goal focuses on my professional development part of my education. I intend on doing daily posts about my progress throughout this journey, and what lessons I've learned throughout each day. Naturally this means my posts will be more short-form, but I feel as though that format would be best for me in not only learning but presenting my thoughts to the world. My third goal: ***Document Web Development progress*** .

Fourthly, I wanted to take into account a challenge that I once saw while looking up coding practices. This challenge is the 100 Days of Code Challenge. This challenge is essentially an opportunity to help build better coding practices through consistency of workload. It challenges me to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. This isn't an individual goal separate from the others, but still something I wanted to highlight as important for my journey. Fourth goal: ***100 Days of Code Challenge***

Finally, I wish to build up all these habits by keeping constant communication with my education coach. Needless to say, having more people in your corner can help you immensely. I wish to make sure that I make use of this resource that Flatiron School, as well as make her job easier by constantly updating her on both my progress in Flatiron School as well as possible changes in study habits that I have found to be more effective. I have a great team with me on this journey, and it's important to make sure I keep them in the know so they can help me out most efficiently. Fifth and final goal: ***Keep in touch with Education Coach***

## Final Remarks

Thank you for reading this entire post! I hope that through writing out my thoughts and plan, I can re-ignite my career in Web Development. Hope to be writing to you soon!
