Hello everyone!  I'm Joshua Tan, a recent graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park.  I have been a student at the Flatiron School for a while now, but never really got to the blog creation part of the course.  To be more specific, I was unable to adhere to the 4-6 month timeline I expected of myself when starting this course.  In fact, I am on my 11th month technically.  None of that has to do with how the Flatiron teaches the course.  I believe that this education provided to me by the Flatiron School has been exponentially more valuable than the one I received when I first took a shot at Computer Science during my Freshman year of college.  The community is very encouraging, and the attention that's given to each student is amazing.  Unfortunately, a lot of roadblocks came into my life that stopped me from giving my full attention to Flatiron School.  My life has changed for the better recently, and I am finally taking the opportunity to fulfill my career dream of becoming a Software Engineer.  Okay, so now you have an understanding of where I am in my life, but now to actually answer the question: Why did I decide to pursue Software Development?



Growing up, I initially wanted to become a doctor.  This was the plan until my Senior year of high school when the thought of being face to face with mortality on a daily basis started to lose its appeal.  Granted, I was born into a family of doctors, so that may have been a part of it.  I was on the verge of graduating high school without knowing what I wanted to pursue in college.  I scrambled to think of different opportunities I could pursue.  Medicine was always the path laid out for me.  I never really gave any thought to other fields.  I thought about it for a bit, until I realized that what I wanted to do was in front of me the entire time.  I was, and still am, a very enthusiastic gamer.  I loved playing games, and I loved all sorts of creative endeavors.  I know, not necessarily the best inspiration for a career, but it still got me hooked.  Once I looked into it more, it was the other aspects of coding that also stuck out to me.  The problem solving.  The creative aspects.  The design.  I ended up choosing another major at the University of Maryland, but the idea of software development never left my mind.  That's why I decided to not let my decision to pursue Computer Science in university stop me from learning how to code and applied to Flatiron School.
